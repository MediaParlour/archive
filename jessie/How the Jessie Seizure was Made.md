**﻿How the Jessie Seizure was Made﻿**

"Jessie", yes, that word that made almost everyone have Jessie seizure. How it was made you asked?

Anyway, the Jessie seizure started when Rocky asked for subtitles, and then I went ahead and found Web Captioner and started tinkering around with it. I was able to get it work after that.

When I introduce it to the VC, something happened... To make Web Captioner work I simply put an external microphone near to my external speaker (and I was using my laptop)...

After a while, a new word came up in the transcript: "Jessie". We still talk around while still having Web Captioner enabled, and I saw "Jessie" multiple times (and also "yogurt", "oreo", and also "lemon tree" too).

We laughed about the word "Jessie", I also said "JessiePlay Discord" in the VC too. :Sweatsmile:

Things going crazy after that, "Jessie hotel" also appeared in the transcript. (L36 even made a channel for these two, 
deleted-channel and 
deleted-channel). And then more funny words, swear words as well, and others. :flushie:

||~~That was fun for me and I definitely rolling on the floor laughing lmao :rolf:~~||

||also if your name is Jessie I'm sorry, ~~blame Web Captioner's service instead~~||

Oh and also thanks for Afton for the Jessie tupper too...
